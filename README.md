## What is a CMS?

CMS (Content management system), is a program used to create, edit, publish and manage content on digital platforms and pre-structured online pages; allowing it to be modified, removed and added without the need to have knowledge of the HTML markup language. In other words, it is a system that allows the creation, storage and administration of content dynamically

This repository is a historical repository of the lambda forum, I will not update it anymore, I will only work on the new cms api that we are developing in the repository in the LambdaOrder org
